# VM SandPond
This is: a proof-of-concept implementation of the [Substrate VM rules](https://github.com/ajzaff/substrate-mfm-engine/blob/master/MANUAL.md).<br>
It uses my **out-dated** [Habitat](https://github.com/l2wilson94/Habitat-1) library, and the **not-ready** [MotherTode](https://github.com/l2wilson94/MotherTode) language... So it is probably quite unstable.
